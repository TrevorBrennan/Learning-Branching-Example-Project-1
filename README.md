# Learning-Branching-Example-Project-1
This project represents a starting state that students will clone and then attempt various merge/rebase/cherry-picking strategies on locally.

# Reflection

1. What git commands do you know, and how confident are you in your ability to use them?
  
2. In your own words, what do you think branching means in the context of Git?
  
3. Describe when you might want to use each of `git merge`, `git rebase`, and `git cherry-pick`.
